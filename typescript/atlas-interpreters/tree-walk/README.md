# Tree Walk Interpreter for Atlas Language

## Welcome to the Tree Walk Interpreter for Atlas Language!

This project implements a simple interpreter for the Atlas Language using a tree-walking approach. The interpreter processes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated from source code, evaluating expressions and executing statements accordingly.
